                  If you polled 100 people, 99 might say automated customer
                  service is nothing but a pain. They'd rather speak to a human
                  being.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone has a nightmare story: confusing menus that lead in
                  circles or to the wrong department; speech recognition that
                  can't understand common patterns of speech; systems that
                  require users to enter account information but don't pass that
                  information on to the customer service representative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, most of those complaints refer to traditional
                  interactive voice response (IVR) systems, which have
                  limitations. Combined with modern artificial intelligence (AI)
                  technology, IVRs can work smarter. Newer tools such as natural
                  language processing, speech analysis and chatbots make
                  automation friendlier for the customer while also improving
                  productivity in call centers.

                <p>
                  Natural language processing, or NLP, is the AI technology that
                  allows computers to understand human speech as we actually
                  speak it. Old IVR technology could only understand simple
                  words and phrases like “operator” or “pay my bill,” while NLP
                  picks up on complex phrases like “I have a strange fee on my
                  bill that I don't understand” or “I need to change my shipping
                  address.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Customers no longer have to guess at the exact word or phrase
                  a computer might understand to be routed to the correct
                  department; they just speak like they would to a human.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4 id="speechAnalysis">Speech analysis</h4>
                <p>
                  Speech analysis can be used to understand not just what
                  customers say but what kind of mood they're in. Modern call
                  center technology can detect when a caller is angry or
                  frustrated so representatives are prepared to respond to those
                  moods. Calls from irate customers can be routed to
                  representatives who are more experienced, or those who have
                  proven success diffusing situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AI can also pick up on age, vocabulary and vernacular to route
                  callers to the best possible agent. In the future, it is even
                  expected to analyze personalities, matching callers with an
                  agents who communicate in a similar way.

                <p>
                  There's been a lot of chatter about bots this year. Giants
                  like Microsoft and Facebook have launched them, and smaller
                  companies are soon to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chatbots interact with customers via text in a natural,
                  conversational way. They can be used to answer simple
                  questions or troubleshoot more complex problems. What makes
                  chatbots, unlike tools such as Siri, so exciting is that they
                  learn from previous conversations and use that information to
                  make suggestions about what you might need or want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Millennials are likely to appreciate chatbots, as most would
                  rather communicate via text than phone, at least for basic
                  needs and transactions (and as long as the technology works
                  quickly and seamlessly).

                <p>
                  Despite the advancements, most tech experts agree that
                  artificial intelligence will not replace live representatives
                  entirely - at least not anytime soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some questions and issues are simply too complex, requiring
                  the assistance of a human being. Some customers, particularly
                  older people, are resistant to automated systems and will
                  always prefer a live agent. The cost of AI can be prohibitive,
                  too, particularly for small companies or for those who have
                  already invested heavily in more outdated forms of IVR.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the bright side, AI does promise to improve call center
                  operations where it can be implemented by reducing customer
                  frustrations. And, as we all know, happy customers are far
                  more likely to remain loyal to your brand.
